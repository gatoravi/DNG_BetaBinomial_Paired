Denovogear-bb for paired-samples. Ver0.01

These are the installation instructions for Linux, Unix.

You can obtain the latest source code from Github, either download a zip file or clone this repo.
To clone this repo:
Type 
	git clone https://github.com/gatoravi/DNG_BetaBinomial_Paired.git

This code depends on the RInside, Rcpp, RcppClassic and Samtools libraries.
Currently Samtools is packaged with this package but this is poised to change in the future.

To Install Rcpp, RcppClassic and RInside:
1. Make sure you have a working version of R, you need R version>=3.0.
2. Open R and run "install.packages("Rcpp")", "install.packages("RcppClassic") and "install.packages("RInside")

Samtools is a part of this repo, cd into the samtools directory and run make, do the same for bcftools.
cd src/samtools-0.1.18/bcftools/
make
cd src/samtools-0.1.18/
make lib
This will create the necessary library libbam.a which will be linked with the DNG code.

The package also contains an R script named "BBFit.R" in the src/ folder. Move this script to a directory called ~/src/ This is inconvenient but we will hopefully move to a more streamlined installation procedure soon. This script is called by the DNG code.
mkdir ~/src/
cp src/BBFit.R ~/src/

To Install the DNG package:
    cd DNG_BetaBinomial_Paired
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install

Doing the install in a separate build directory is usually recommended as it separates the source from any files created during the install. This ensures a clean src directory.

For instructions on how to run the code see README.txt. The file src/callDNGBB.sh has an example command for running the code.
