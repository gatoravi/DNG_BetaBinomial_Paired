Denovogear-bb for paired-samples. Ver0.01

These are the installation instructions for Linux, Unix.

You can obtain the latest source code from Github, either download a zip file or clone this repo.
To clone this repo:
Type 
	git clone https://github.com/gatoravi/DNG_BetaBinomial_Paired.git

This code depends on the RInside, RCpp and Samtools libraries.
Currently Samtools is packaged with this package but this is poised to change in the future.

To Install Rcpp and RInside:
1. Make sure you have a working version of R, you need R version>=3.0.
2. Open R and run "install.packages("Rcpp")", "install.packages("RInside")

Samtools is a part of this repo, cd into the samtools directory and run make, do the same for bcftools.
cd src/samtools-0.1.18/
make
cd bcftools
make
This will create the necessary library libbam.a which will be linked with the DNG code.

The package also contains an R script named "BBFit.R" in the src/ folder. Move this script to a directory called ~/src/ This is inconvenient but we will hopefully move to a more streamlined installation procedure soon. This script is called by the DNG code.
